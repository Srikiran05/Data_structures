# Data_structure

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C programming language. Each data structure is implemented with detailed explanations and examples of their usage.

## Data Structures Included

1. **Singly Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are connected using pointers.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Similar to a singly linked list but with pointers to both previous and next elements.
3. **Stack**: A last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure used for function call mechanisms and parsing.
4. **Queue**: A first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure used for managing tasks in a sequential manner.
5. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree structure with efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
6. **Heap**: A tree-based data structure with heap properties, often used in priority queues and heap sort.
7. **Hash Table**: A data structure for fast key-value pair storage and retrieval.
8. **Graph**: A non-linear data structure for modeling relationships and networks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-c.git

    1.  Navigate to the data structure directory of your choice:
       cd data-structures-c/singly_linked_list

    2.  Compile the files using GCC:
       gcc example.c data_structure.c -o example

    3.Run the compiled program:
        ./example

Usage:
    Each data structure directory contains:
            Header file ('data_structure.h'): Structure definitions and function prototypes.
            Implementation file ('data_structure.c'): Actual code for data structure functions.
            Example usage file ('example.c'): Demonstrates how to use the data structure with sample operations and output.
